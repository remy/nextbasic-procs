# to allow for a more seamless transition from screen to screen, I'll call this
# routine which puts the shadow layer in front and all further printing, tiles
# etc, will be hidden (in banks 9-11) and when I'm ready, I'll call defrost
# which throws away the shadow layer bringing all the new visuals into view.
