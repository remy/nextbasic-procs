# this logic is based on the Fisher-Yates/Knuth shuffle and partly based on
# http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Knuth_shuffle#Sinclair_ZX81_BASIC but IIRC I made
# modifications to optimise and ensure I got the points I needed. I'd try to
# explain it, but it's easier all round if you familiarise yourself with the
# shuffle - it's very useful!
